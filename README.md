# Completely fake project PURELY to practice git


## Studying from [atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/) and random stack overflow questions. 


There are some GIT concepts / "things happening" I'm not fully comprehending, so rather than practice git on real projects, I made this fake project purely for learning and practicing GIT with. So it's **completely okay** to **completely break** it ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ 


## Concepts / "things happening" I'm trying to understand better

----

tracked files  
VS   
untracked files   

... If I checkout a past commit current untracked files are removed from disk (but I don't think they're deleted... I think?)

----

when files actually get deleted from disk (in which case, they don't even go to the recycle bin so they're gone forever ðŸ˜­ , how would I undo that?)    
VS   
not getting deleted from disk, just from git tracking   

----

$ git commit --amend   
... will try to open an editor in the cli? I think. Something happens in the cli I don't understand, I had the project open in vs code
and I think that messed something up. 

----

Removing a file from ALL OF git history.   
... for example,  accidently commiting and pushing a config file that contains the db connection info and not realizing it till wayyyyy later. 
This would have to get removed from the entire history but leave all the other commits alone. 

----

undoing commits that have already been pushed to the remote repo. 

----

**TONS** of other stuff I on rare occasion come accross, but don't have the time to really learn and understand. A lot times I wish there was a quick "ctrl-z" I can do with git commands I do. *sigh* ðŸ˜”
